# Why humbird?

Combining MobX and React is so good, so why we create humbird?

The main idea of humbird is to **give you a way to organize your MobX stores and the whole application**. Because MobX is too free for us write maintainable code easily. You may put the stores (observable) every where and finally get mess.

Also, **we want to put the MobX best practice into humbird** in the future. The framework will help you structure all your stores (we call `model` in humbird) and seperate *UI Sotre* and *domain store*.
